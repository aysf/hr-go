## Question

Even differences:

To have the sum of adjacent elements even, the difference between the first and last elements has to be even in the sorted array.

    Sort the array.
    Find the first and last occurrence of the even number in the array.
    Find the first and last occurrence of the odd number in the array.

  The answer is the maximum difference between the first and last occurrence of the even number in the array and the first and last occurrence of the odd number in the array.
